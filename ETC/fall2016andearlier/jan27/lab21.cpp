// lab21.cpp
//
// Go back and modify lab20.cpp as follows:
// Convert the distance (which is in feet) to both yards and miles
// Output the distance in yards and also miles.
//
// You may declare two additional double variables called yards and miles.
// NOTE: 1 foot = 0.333 yards
//       1 foot = 0.000189394 miles
//
// Test data
// time = 10, distance = 1600,  yards =   532.8, miles =  0.3030
// time = 60, distance = 57600, yards = 19180.8, miles = 10.9091
