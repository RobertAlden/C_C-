//Spring 2016                                   Functions
//The purpose of this assignment is to implement and test a library of functions that may be used in future programs.
//Create a file called mylibrary and implement each of the following functions in this file.
//To test these functions create the main function in a separate file called prog5.cpp. After coding each function in mylibrary,
// call it several times from main (in file prog5.cpp) and test it.
//Important: the comment statements inside each function must also be included in mylibrary.
// file:        mylibrary
// Author: your name
// Date:             last date this file was modified
// This file contains a library of useful functions.

{
  // This function receives the height of a person in feet and inches; it also receives the weight in pounds.
  // The function returns the hat size for the person using this formula:
  // weight divided by height (total inches) and all that multiplied by 2.9
  // Note: feet and inches should be converted to all inches before using the formula.
  // Example: 5 feet, 8 inches = 5 * 12 + 8 = 68 inches
